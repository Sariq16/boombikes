## General Information
- **Background**: A bike-sharing system allows individuals to use bikes on a short-term basis, either for a fee or for free. BoomBikes, a US provider, 
                    has suffered revenue losses due to the pandemic and aims to understand bike demand post-pandemic to strategize effectively.
- **Business Problem**: BoomBikes needs to understand the factors affecting bike demand to prepare for post-pandemic recovery and increase their market share.
- **Dataset**: The dataset includes daily bike demand across the American market, influenced by various factors such as weather, season, and user type 
                (casual vs. registered).

## Conclusions
- Certain variables significantly predict the demand for shared bikes.
- The model provides insights into how these variables impact bike demand.
- BoomBikes can use the model to tailor their business strategy to meet future demand.
- Understanding demand dynamics can help BoomBikes stand out in a competitive market.
